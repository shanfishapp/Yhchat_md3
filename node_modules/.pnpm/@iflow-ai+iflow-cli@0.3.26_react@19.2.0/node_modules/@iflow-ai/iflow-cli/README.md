If you are in China Mainland, you can use the following command to install iFlow CLI:
1. Go to https://cloud.iflow.cn/iflow-cli/nvm-setup.exe to download the latest nvm installer
2. Run the installer to install nvm
3. **Restart your terminal: CMD or PowerShell**
4. Run `nvm node_mirror https://npmmirror.com/mirrors/node/` and `nvm npm_mirror https://npmmirror.com/mirrors/npm/`
5. Run `nvm install 22` to install Node.js 22
6. Run `nvm use 22` to use Node.js 22
7. Run `npm install -g @iflow-ai/iflow-cli` to install iFlow CLI
8. Run `iflow` to start iFlow CLI

## 🔑 Authentication

iFlow offers two authentication options:

1. **Recommended**: Use iFlow's native authentication
2. **Alternative**: Connect via OpenAI-compatible APIs

After generating your key, paste it into the terminal prompt to complete setup.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To launch iFlow CLI, navigate to your workspace in the terminal and type:

```shell
iflow
```

### Starting New Projects

For new projects, simply describe what you want to create:

```shell
cd new-project/
iflow
> Create a web-based Minecraft game using HTML
```

### Working with Existing Projects

For existing codebases, begin with the `/init` command to help iFlow understand your project:

```shell
cd project1/
iflow
> /init
> Analyze the requirements according to the PRD document in requirement.md file, and output a technical document, then implement the solution.
```

The `/init` command scans your codebase, learns its structure, and creates an IFLOW.md file with comprehensive documentation.

For a complete list of slash commands and usage instructions, see [here](./docs/cli/commands.md).

## 💡 Common Use Cases

iFlow CLI extends beyond coding to handle a wide range of tasks:

## 🔧 Switch to Custom Model

iFlow CLI can connect to any OpenAI-compatible API. Edit the settings file in `~/.iflow/settings.json` to change the model you use.

Here is a settings demo file:
```json
{
    "theme": "Default",
    "selectedAuthType": "iflow",
    "apiKey": "your iflow key",
    "baseUrl": "https://apis.iflow.cn/v1",
    "modelName": "Qwen3-Coder",
    "searchApiKey": "your iflow key"
}
```

## 🐛 Crash Debugging

If you encounter runtime crashes, you can enable crash diagnostics to collect detailed information for debugging:

### Enable Crash Diagnostics

```bash
# Enable crash debugging mode
DEBUG=true iflow

# Or with additional Node.js debugging flags
DEBUG=true node --trace-warnings --trace-uncaught node_modules/.bin/iflow
```

### System Configuration for Core Dumps

**macOS:**
```bash
# Enable core dumps
ulimit -c unlimited
sudo sysctl -w kern.coredump=1
```

**Linux:**
```bash
# Configure core dump pattern and enable unlimited core dumps
echo 'core.%p.%t' | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
ulimit -c unlimited
```

### Crash Information Collection

When `DEBUG=true` is enabled, the system will:

1. **Generate crash files** - Create `crash-[timestamp]-[pid].json` files containing:
   - Complete error stack trace
   - Memory usage information
   - Process information (PID, uptime, Node.js version)
   - Environment variables
   - Platform and architecture details

2. **Create core dumps** - Generate system core dumps for advanced debugging

3. **Monitor warnings** - Log Node.js warnings and unhandled promise rejections

### Analyzing Crash Files

The generated crash files contain structured JSON data that can help identify:
- The exact error that caused the crash
- Memory usage patterns before the crash
- System environment and configuration
- Call stack at the time of crash

Share these files when reporting crash issues for faster debugging assistance.
